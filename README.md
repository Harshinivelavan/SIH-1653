SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software

## Problem Description


Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea

 1.Leveling of questions: The application must be thought to ask from ice breaking questions to
 talent identification questions.
 
 
 2.Data collection: The data collection must be based on a persons previous experiences,
 educational qualifications and skills to make it more unbiased.
 
 
 3.Accurte response identification: While capturing responses keywords and ideas must be identified
 correctly.
 
 
 4.Appropriate grading: A score ranging from 1-10 must be given for each response.
 
 
 5.Acceptibility: When the score reaches above the given criteria, the candidate should be accepted
 and data should be stored to review later.
